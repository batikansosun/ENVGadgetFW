# Intro

ENV Gadget is a framework that helps you to easily manage the service end-points, service keys and other constants.

# Configuration

Add your project root directory to the config file named data.json. This file contains what you have needed for your app. This can be service endpoint, authentication keys or others.

# Configuration Structure

The JSON file begins with the list object that includes all child lists. The child list item has three params. These are key, value and selected.

<b>the key keep readable row name,</b>
<b>the value keep row value,</b>
<b>and then selected to keep the state of the currently selected row.</b>

```
{
   "list":[
      {
         "key":"Service URLs",
         "childList":[
            {
               "key":"Live",
               "value":"https://auth.example.com/live/",
               "selected":true
            },
            {
               "key":"Test",
               "value":"https://auth.example.com/test/",
               "selected":false
            },
            {
               "key":"Dev",
               "value":"https://auth.example.com/dev/",
               "selected":false
            }
